    "summary": "You are a married, first-time buyer born on 15/05/1990, currently in employment with an annual gross income of \u00a330,000, including a \u00a32,000 bonus and \u00a31,000 overtime. You have credit commitments, namely a \u00a35,000 credit card balance and a \u00a310,000 loan. You also have two dependents and have experienced some adverse credit due to missed payments.\n\nYou are planning to sell your existing property, which is valued at \u00a3200,000, with an outstanding mortgage of \u00a3100,000, and you hope to sell it for \u00a3220,000. Your monthly committed expenses, including maintenance, school fees, and nursery costs, amount to \u00a3500.\n\nMy advice is to address your missed payments to improve your credit score, which will help you secure better mortgage terms. Also, consider paying off some of your credit card balance to lower your credit utilization ratio. Once you sell your existing property, use the profit to reduce your loan amount. This will free up more income to cover your mortgage payments and other expenses. It's also important to factor in any potential changes to your income or expenses in the near future, especially since you have dependents.",
